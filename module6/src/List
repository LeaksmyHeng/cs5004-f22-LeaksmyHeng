Java splits ADT into an interface, declaring
what operations are supported, as well as several concrete classes implementing
this interface.

Java List is using normal linked List. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html
But Java Library Linked List (different from Java List) is using the doubly linked list. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html
