Prof. Keith is on the move! His Velocity =0.34641016151377546
Encountered an error: Elapsed time for velocity cannot be less than or equal to 0

The lines above are the first run in which the Point3D one = new Point3D() and
Pointer3D two = new Point3D(1, 1, 1). The first line invoked Point3D object to called
distanceTo method. Hence, the first line is just printing out the result of the distanceTo method.
We saw a lot of decimal points or precision because distanceTo method return double. The second line
prints out the invoke Physics object. The object is then called its method velocity. We saw a lot of
decimal because velocity returns double. The third line threw an illegal argument rather than
calculating the velocity because our elapsedTime is equal 0 and that is illegal as we defined
it in our velocity method under Physics class.

This is the second run of Physics class. We swapped the elapsedTime values in the method calls
such that 5 becomes 0 and the 0 becomes 5. This first line is the same as the first run; it calculated 
the distanceTo method. We see a lot of precision or decimal because distanceTo return double. 
Also because of the swap, when the program calculated the velocity, it hit the 0 elapsed time. 
We handled it gracefully by throwing a new IllegalArgumentException. That causes the current method 
exit immediately after throwing that exception. That is why we only see the 
"Encountered an error: Elapsed time.... equal to 0" and the next line of code when 
elapsedTime = 5 not getting executed.
